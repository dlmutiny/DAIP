Domain Array Index Prediction through Image Recognition uses ComputerÂ Vision and Machine Learning to predict the future Array of a Domain.

I'm developing a method for indexing the number of surfers in the water at a surf spot at a designated time. With the recorded data, predictions can be made on crowed levels on future time and dates.

# Ongoing Development Plans
1. Currently testing proof of concept with Malibu Overview, Pleasure Point and Cowell's Overview. Will be running tests mainly on Pleasure Point. Will plan on adding more locations for permanent data set recording.

2. Better accuracy for wave conditions at the time for the measurement.

3. Improve surfer detection.
