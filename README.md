Domain Array Index Prediction is a meathod for predicting the future Array of a Domain.

I'm developing a method for indexing the number of surfers in the water at a designated time. With the recorded data, predictions can be made on crowed levels on future time and date.

# Ongoing Development Plans
1. Currently testing proof of concept with Malibu (North Los Angeles), Pleasure Point (Santa Cruz), Jacks AKA 38th (Santa Cruz), Cowells (Santa Cruz), Huntington North and South (North Orange). Will plan on adding more locations for permanent data set recording. The project is young and is driven on historical data. My prediction model will be more accurate with multiple years of data.

2. Better accuracy for wave conditions at the time for the measurement.

3. ~~Improve surfer detection.~~   DONE

4. Improve prediction model.

5. Add more surf spots. Earlier the better. The more yearly data I have the more accurate my prediction model becomes.

6. Competition tracker. Account for days that have surf comps.

7. Develop an interface so users can easly access data. Right now you will find a CSV file containing a date and time next year with a predicted Crowd Index Level.
